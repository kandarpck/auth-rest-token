# auth-rest-token
Token based Login and Registration using Django

Your challenge is to create and deploy a website frontend and accompanying REST API backend, each written in a different programming language.
 
The website should allow users to register and log in with a username and password.  Authenticated users should have access to a “greeting” page that calls up to your backend API for a personalized greeting and displays it to the user. Call your API with a signed token that identifies the user and is valid for 30 minutes.
 
Your backend should have one endpoint that validates the token and responds with a greeting message addressing the user by name.
 
Include unit tests.
 
You’re encouraged to make use of existing open-source projects where appropriate.
 
Finally, submit your code and a URL to a live demo for evaluation.
